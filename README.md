### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an chocolate manufacturing company over the pasr year. By analysing the various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trend, make data driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for the analysis is the 'file_name.csv' file, containing detailed inormation about each sale made by the company.

### Tools Used

- MS Excel - For data cleaning
- MySQL - For analysing the data

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase I've performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales period?


### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/feature you've worked with

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE cond1;
```
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name2
WHERE cond2;
```

### Results/Findings

The anlysis results are summarized as follows:
- The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticable peak during the holiday season.
- Product category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketting and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in category A.


### Limitations

I've to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my calculations from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the cleaning but even then i can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and revenue.
